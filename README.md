# FocusNET

This repository contains the code necessary for training the FocusNET model,
which is a regression CNN that aims to predict the optimal reconstruction
distance from a given hologram acquired using DLHM. The training dataset 
can be downloaded from the [hugging face repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mmonto95/focusnet/tree/main).
