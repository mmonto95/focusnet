# FocusNET

This repository contains the code necessary for training the FocusNET model,
which is a regression CNN that aims to predict the optimal reconstruction
distance from a given hologram acquired using DLHM. The training dataset 
and the best trained model can be downloaded from the
[hugging face repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mmonto95/focusnet/tree/main).
